# How to Start Discovery

<div class="column-wrapper" markdown>
<div class="column" markdown>

### How to Start
1. Anyone can start Discovery. Invite a buddy who is also excited about Discovery.
2. Make a broader list of people you know and pray for them to Jesus.
3. Set a date and place for the first Discovery. Meet regularly.
4. Invite people. Invite them repeatedly. Practice what you'll tell them:
    - Hi John, have you ever tried reading the Bible? I don't mean religion or church, just the Bible.
    - With friends, we do this exploratory Bible reading. We meet at a caf√© or someone's home. About an hour and a half.
    - We share how we're doing, read a short story about Jesus from the Bible together, and talk about it.
    - Friends are surprised by how interesting and useful it is!
    - Some are complete non-believers. Everyone discovers something for themselves.
    - Sometimes someone says: Wow, that's in the Bible?!
    - I'm sure you'll find it interesting too!
    - Get two or three friends together and try it with me!
5. At the first meeting, instead of "Return", get to know each other a bit. Briefly explain that the Bible is a library and that books have chapters and paragraphs.
6. Regularly consult with Jesus and someone more experienced in guiding Discovery.

### Tips
- Provide Bibles, or print the reading section for everyone, or use a mobile app (e.g., [YouVersion](https://www.bible.com/app)).
- When finding a passage, also mention the page number.
- Try to have different people guide each third. From the third meeting, let new participants guide too. Give them Discovery guiding notes so they can read the questions.
- Sometimes no one shows up. That's an opportunity to talk with Jesus and invite more people.
